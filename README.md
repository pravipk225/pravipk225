# Praveen Kumar Ravichandran  
### Cloud-Native QA Architect

👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m **Praveen**, a Cloud-Native QA Architect with **9+ years of experience** across **FinTech and Healthcare**.  
I specialize in **architecting quality into distributed systems**, ensuring reliability, scalability, and speed in complex microservices environments.

> My philosophy: **Quality is an engineering discipline, not a phase.**

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I help organizations move faster **without sacrificing reliability** by designing cloud-native, automation-first quality strategies.

### 🔹 Automation Architecture
- Architect scalable **Playwright + TypeScript** frameworks adopted across multiple teams
- Reduce brittle end-to-end tests using **Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (Pact)**
- Build UI, API, and service-level automation that scales with microservices

### 🔹 Cloud-Native & DevOps Quality
- Design automation that runs **cloud-aware and cost-efficient** in CI/CD
- Integrate testing into **Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Jenkins**
- Drive **Shift-Left** adoption by embedding quality into developer workflows

### 🔹 AI-Driven Quality Engineering
- Apply **AI-assisted testing**, Prompt Engineering, and GenAI tools
- Accelerate test creation and improve maintainability
- Explore observability-driven testing using metrics and logs
